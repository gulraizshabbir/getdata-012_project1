# getdata-012_project1

I have created two dataset

1)  as required: it gives the column names as activities, and mean or sd;
                      row names as the variables 

Columns: ACTIVITIES with mean or standard deviation
ROWS: All variables




2)I have made a tidy data set in a 3D table 
dimx is ACTIVITY
dimy is mean or standard deviation
dimz is the value of variables


A function is used: e.g. 
show(mean,STANDING)

it gives the data frame with the mean of values of variables in STANDING position
